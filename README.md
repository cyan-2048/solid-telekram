Telegram client for KaiOS.

### Made with

## Additional Info

- First launch of the app might take a while, the next app launches will not take so long.
- Currently Forum Groups will act in a unstable "View as Messages" view as in the Telegram Web K client.
- pre-optimized lottie stickers are pre-converted apng images so client side rendering is not an issue, those stickers can be found in [kaigram-assets](https://github.com/cyan-2048/kaigram-assets), non optimized stickers will run at a very horrible fps
- using this app on a 256MB RAM KaiOS device is kinda unstable.

### Cache

- the cache is stored in the sdcard/storage delete the kaigram folder to clear the cache.

### Experimental Low Memory mode

- this mode is now disabled
- the chat list will render only 10 chats and scrolling down will render more
- if the app still crashes, please contact the dev.

## Developing

Install NodeJS (v18 or latest LTS) and [bun](https://bun.sh/).

Please create a `.env.local` file and add the values in `.env` replacing the APP_ID and APP_HASH with your own.

You **must** use bun!

Dev Mode:

> [!NOTE]  
> There is an unresolved issue with 2fa when using the dev mode, I have no idea what's wrong with it, works fine on KaiOS 2.5.

```
bun run dev
```

Build:

```
bun run build
```

After building, you can now sideload the dist folder using WebIDE.

add the `:v3` suffix for KaiOS 3.0 (example: `bun run dev:v3`)

## Technical Info

- For KaiOS 2.5, the app utilizes _real_ asm.js and on KaiOS 3.0 it uses WebAssembly like normal.
- mtcute is modified to use jsbi, this means BigInt can be used in KaiOS 2.5 and native BigInts are used for KaiOS 3.0.
- mtcute is also modified in order for asm.js to be used.
- there are 3 Web Workers
  - mtcute web worker proxy
  - heavy tasks worker for blocking operations (webp to png, md5, etc.)
  - rlottie
- SystemJS is used to simulate esm modules on KaiOS 2.5, it is also used to import asm.js files in order for it to preserve asm.js syntax.
